This sketch uses an SVG to mock up the LEDs on Loquacious and Lovely.

Most of the code is in the Arduino class.  The class is intended to
as close to as compatible with the Arduino code as possible.  Lines
marked with "// C" are Arduino-specific, lines marked with 
"// Java" are Processing specific.
